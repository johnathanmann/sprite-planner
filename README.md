# sprite-planner

This project was made as an effort to practice my full stack skills as I've just finished my coding bootcamp. Additonally I wanted to test my skills with vanilla CSS as in the past I've relied heavily on Bootstrap.

## Design Process

The UI design of this site was 100% inspired by that of the photo viewer in Metal Gear Solid 2 which was created in universe by Hal "Otacon" Emmerich. The whole Metal Gear series has a lot of UI design I love, especially Metal Gear Solid 3. I figured Otacon, a computer programer and engineer, could have used a site like this himself in his own programming endeavors. During some of the font searching I did for this prject I found this cool blog post about the intent of font in MGS check it out [here](https://metalgearstuff.wordpress.com/2020/01/29/the-fonts-of-metal-gear-solid/) if your interested!
