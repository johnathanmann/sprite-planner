# sprite-planner

This project was made as an effort to practice my full stack skills jus tout of my coding bootcamp. Additonally I was seriously inspired by some UI deisgn in the Metal gear Solid video game series and I wanted to learn more about it and incoorporate it into a project.

## Design Process

The UI design and the little character (Otacon) on the project page were all designed in reference to Metal Gear Solid 2 and the photo viewer screens during the Tanker portion of the game. The whole metal gear series has a lot of UI design I love, especially Metal Gear Solid 3. I figured Otacon, a computer programer and engineer, could have used a site like this himself in his own programming endeavors. During some of the font searching I did for this prject I found this cool blog post about the intent of font in MGS check it out if [here](https://metalgearstuff.wordpress.com/2020/01/29/the-fonts-of-metal-gear-solid/) your interested!
